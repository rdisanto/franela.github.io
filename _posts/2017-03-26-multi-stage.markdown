## Prerequisites
This tutorial will need the `master` build of Docker, which is available on Play With Docker. 

## Multi-staged builds

A common pipe-line for building applications in Docker involves adding SDKs and runtimes, followed by adding code and building it. The most efficient way to get a small image tends to be to use 2-3 Dockerfiles with different filenames where each one takes the output of the last. This is referred to as the *Builder pattern* in the Docker community.

This lab explores a new bleeding-edge feature called Multi-stage builds. It is not yet released into a Docker version, but when it is available on the Docker Hub/Cloud and for all the Docker editions it will mean we can use a single Dockerfile with multiple stages instead of the *Builder pattern*.

Let's build a simple Golang application which counts internal/external facing anchor tags to help us come up with an SEO rating.

Let's try out the href-counter Docker image from the hub, then look at how to re-build from the Github repository:

```.term1
docker run -e url=https://news.ycombinator.com alexellis2/href-counter
```
```
{"internal":197,"external":32}
```

You get a JSON object returned giving the total amount of internal vs external links.

Let's clone the source:

```.term1
git clone https://github.com/alexellis/href-counter
cd href-counter
```
```
Cloning into 'href-counter'...
remote: Counting objects: 24, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (19/19), done.
remote: Total 24 (delta 7), reused 12 (delta 1), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (24/24), done.
```

## The old way of doing things

Let's build the Docker image with all the Golang toolchain and see how big the image comes out as:

```.term1
docker build -t alexellis2/href-counter:sdk . -f Dockerfile.build
```

Now check the size of the image:

```.term1
docker images |grep href-counter
```
```
docker images |grep href-counter
href-counter        sdk                 131c782e8c35        30 second
s ago      692MB
```

The `docker history` command will show you that the layers we added during the build are only a small part of the resulting image (about 20MB +/-):

```.term1
docker history alexellis2/href-counter:sdk |head -n 4
```
```
IMAGE               CREATED             CREATED BY
                   SIZE                COMMENT
f8b1953fb9c7        1 second ago        /bin/sh -c CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go bui...   5.64MB
5d24895500e8        9 seconds ago       /bin/sh -c #(nop) COPY file:d3eec1f1fefbec...   1.71kB
d83dc0785057        9 seconds ago       /bin/sh -c go get -d -v golang.org/x/net/html   13.6MB
c6f59b210906        11 seconds ago      /bin/sh -c #(nop) WORKDIR /go/src/github.c...   0B
```

The image is quite large, but this Golang package can be built into a very small binary with no external dependencies, then added to an Alpine Linux base image.

## The builder pattern

Type in `cat builder.sh` so you can see how the builder pattern uses two separate Dockerfiles. This will help us get the context for the next step where we will use a single Dockerfile.

```.term1
./build.sh
```
```
#!/bin/sh
echo Building alexellis2/href-counter:build

docker build -t alexellis2/href-counter:build . -f Dockerfile.build
docker create --name extract alexellis2/href-counter:build
docker cp extract:/go/src/github.com/alexellis/href-counter/app ./app
docker rm -f extract

echo Building alexellis2/href-counter:latest
docker build -t alexellis2/href-counter:latest .
```

As you can see there are quite a few intermediate steps required to create an optimized image using the *Builder pattern*.

Let's see how big the Docker image came out as:

```.term1
docker images |grep alexellis2/href-counter
```

This is much smaller than when we built our first image with the Golang SDK included.

## Multi-stage build example

While the builder pattern helps us achieve a small image, it does require extra leg-work for every piece of software we want to package in Docker.

Here is where multi-stage builds help us out. Instead of using a shell script to orchestrate two separate Dockerfiles, we can just use one and define stages throughout.

To use the Dockerfile.multi file in the Github repository to do a multi-stage build, then check the size of the resulting image against that of the image created by the Golang SDK base and the builder pattern.

```.term1
docker build -t alexellis2/href-counter:multi . -f Dockerfile.multi
```
```
docker images |grep href-counter
alexellis2/href-counter   multi               44852229a1cc        2 minutes ago       10.3MB
alexellis2/href-counter   latest              bb997f819fbb        3 minutes ago       10.3MB
alexellis2/href-counter   build               298d3b970412        4 minutes ago       692MB
alexellis2/href-counter   sdk                 298d3b970412        4 minutes ago       692MB
alexellis2/href-counter   <none>              b0a73b688243        13 days ago         11.6MB
```

Here is an example of building "Hello World" in Go.

Create a new folder:
```.term1
mkdir hello
cd hello
```

Create the app.go file:

```.term1
echo 'package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello world!")
}
' | tee app.go
```

Create a Dockerfile with the following contents:

```.term1
echo '
FROM golang:1.7.3
COPY app.go .
RUN go build -o app app.go

FROM scratch
COPY --from=0 /go/app .
CMD ["./app"]
' | tee Dockerfile
```

Now build and run the Dockerfile:

```.term1
docker build -t hello-world-lab .
docker run hello-world-lab
```

The resulting size of hello-world is very small:

```.term1
docker images |grep hello-world-lab
```

## More about the lab

This lab was built from a [blog post](http://blog.alexellis.io/mutli-stage-docker-builds/). by [Alex Ellis](https://twitter.com/alexellisuk)

* Blog: [Builder pattern vs. Multi-stage builds in Docker](http://blog.alexellis.io/mutli-stage-docker-builds/).

> Note: We do not recommend moving over to multi-stage builds until they are fully available on the Docker Hub/Cloud and all editions of Docker. The example in `build.sh` provides an interim solution for using separate Dockerfiles to build and ship code.
